Introduction
------------

The py-earth package is a Python implementation of Jerome Friedman's Multivariate Adaptive 
Regression Splines algorithm, in the style of scikit-learn.  For more information about Multivariate 
Adaptive Regression Splines, see below.  Py-earth is written in Python and Cython.  It 
provides an interface that is compatible with scikit-learn's Estimator, Predictor, Transformer, and Model 
interfaces.  Py-earth accommodates input in the form of numpy arrays, pandas DataFrames, patsy DesignMatrix 
objects, or most anything that can be converted into an arrray of floats.  Fitted models can be pickled for 
later use.  


Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines
----------------------------------------

Multivariate adaptive regression splines, implemented by the Earth class, is a flexible 
regression method that automatically searches for interactions and non-linear 
relationships.  Earth models can be thought of as linear models in a higher dimensional 
basis space.  Each term in an Earth model is a product of so called "hinge functions".  
A hinge function is a function that's equal to its argument where that argument is greater 
than zero and is zero everywhere else.

.. math::
	\text{h}\left(x-t\right)=\left[x-t\right]_{+}=\begin{cases}
	x-t, & x>t\\
	0, & x\leq t
	\end{cases}

An Earth model is a linear combination of basis functions, each of which is a product of one 
or more of the following:

	1. A constant
	2. Linear functions of input variables
	3. Hinge functions of input variables  

For example, a simple piecewise linear function in one variable can be expressed 
as a linear combination of two hinge functions and a constant (see below).  During fitting, the Earth class 
automatically determines which variables and basis functions to use.  
The algorithm has two stages.  First, the 
forward pass searches for terms that locally minimize squared error loss on the training set.  Next, a pruning pass selects a subset of those 
terms that produces a locally minimal generalized cross-validation (GCV) score.  The GCV 
score is not actually based on cross-validation, but rather is meant to approximate a true
cross-validation score by penalizing model complexity.  The final result is a set of basis functions
that is nonlinear in the original feature space, may include interactions, and is likely to 
generalize well.

	y=1-2\text{h}\left(1-x\right)+\frac{1}{2}\text{h}\left(x-1\right)

	import numpy
	from pyearth import Earth
	from matplotlib import pyplot
    
	#Create some fake data
	numpy.random.seed(0)
	m = 1000
	n = 10
	X = 80*numpy.random.uniform(size=(m,n)) - 40
	y = numpy.abs(X[:,6] - 4.0) + 1*numpy.random.normal(size=m)
    
	#Fit an Earth model
	model = Earth()
	model.fit(X,y)
    
	#Print the model
	print model.trace()
	print model.summary()
    
	#Plot the model
	y_hat = model.predict(X)
	pyplot.figure()
	pyplot.plot(X[:,6],y,'r.')
	pyplot.plot(X[:,6],y_hat,'b.')
	pyplot.xlabel('x_6')
