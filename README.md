py-earth
========

A Python implementation of Jerome Friedman's Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines algorithm, 
in the style of scikit-learn.  I would like to add this code to sklearn in the near future and not maintain 
this separate package.

##Description

The py-earth package implements Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines using Cython and provides an interface that 
is compatible with scikit-learn's Estimator, Predictor, Transformer, and Model interfaces.  For more information about 
Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, see the references below.

##Installation

Make sure you have numpy and scikit-learn installed.  Then do the following:

```
git clone git://github.com/jcrudy/py-earth.git
cd py-earth
sudo python setup.py install
```

##Usage
```python
import numpy
from pyearth import Earth
from matplotlib import pyplot
    
#Create some fake data
numpy.random.seed(0)
m = 1000
n = 10
X = 80*numpy.random.uniform(size=(m,n)) - 40
y = numpy.abs(X[:,6] - 4.0) + 1*numpy.random.normal(size=m)
    
#Fit an Earth model
model = Earth()
model.fit(X,y)
    
#Print the model
print model.trace()
print model.summary()
    
#Plot the model
y_hat = model.predict(X)
pyplot.figure()
pyplot.plot(X[:,6],y,'r.')
pyplot.plot(X[:,6],y_hat,'b.')
pyplot.xlabel('x_6')
pyplot.ylabel('y')
pyplot.title('Simple Earth Example')
pyplot.show()
 ```
 
##Other Implementations

I am aware of the following implementations of Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines:

1. The R package earth (coded in C by Stephen Millborrow): http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/earth/index.html
2. The R package mda (coded in Fortran by Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani): http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mda/index.html
3. The Orange data mining library for Python (uses the C code from 1): http://orange.biolab.si/
4. The xtal package (uses Fortran code written in 1991 by Jerome Friedman): http://www.ece.umn.edu/users/cherkass/ee4389/xtalpackage.html
5. MARSplines by StatSoft: http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/multivariate-adaptive-regression-splines/
6. MARS by Salford Systems (also uses Friedman's code): http://www.salford-systems.com/products/mars
7. ARESLab (written in Matlab by Gints Jekabsons): http://www.cs.rtu.lv/jekabsons/regression.html

The R package earth was most useful to me in understanding the algorithm, particularly because of Stephen Milborrow's 
thorough and easy to read vignette (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/earth/vignettes/earth-notes.pdf).
